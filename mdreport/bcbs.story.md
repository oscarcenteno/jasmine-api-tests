# Key Risk Reports

Observing risks
Andrew is in charge of observing a risk for "market price" rag value monthly (input observation), for a key risk report (krr) that the "Compliance" division produces weekly. The report is expected to be completed on certain dates (cob dates).

Analysing risk reports
Iza reviews the dashboard that aggregates the points (mps) they are measuring periodically (cob dates), and offers comments for their performance.

Configuration
Debra is in charge of updating the conditions for risk reports (krr), including:
- creating krrs, completing their information (save, submit, decommission)
- adding mps
- configuring cob dates and their statuses.

John certifies conditions for the krms periodically.
