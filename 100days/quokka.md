Live playground for JS

While watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=568g8hxJJp4, I see his code speaks to him.

Went to https://quokkajs.com/
and read the intro:
https://quokkajs.com/docs/

works great with new JS files:

Try it!

class C{
  add(x, y){
    return x + y;
  }
}

var x = 1;

// x();

y = 1;

z = y + x;
z;

var q = new C().add(1, 2);
q;
